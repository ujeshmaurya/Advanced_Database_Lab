PROBLEM:
Given a SQL Query (comprising only of select statement with all kind of variations), your task is to build a parse tree for that query if the query is legal otherwise print some error message.

SOLUTION:
Step 1: Write a custom grammar for Select statement in SQL. The grammar should not be ambiguous and it cannot be left recursive.
	Progress:---work in progress---
	Issues: matched string constants to be in quotes(inverted commas)
		numeric constants should be allowed
		

Step 2: Build a Parser that can parse a string of input according to a grammar, both fed at runtime.
	Progress: ---DONE--- using LEX and BISON

Step 3: Make a front end which can visualize the parse tree according to grammar.
	Progress: HINT: Use graphviz in pypy.
